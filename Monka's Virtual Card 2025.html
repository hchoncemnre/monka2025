                        <strong> Hi baby! </strong>
                        <p> Happy 27th birthday~ :>  &hearts;
                        I haven't coded in a while, so this was a bit stressful for me
                        but I also used online resources, YouTube and ChatGPT HAHA... 
                        <br> Honestly, I could've just used free apps, they have a lot of 
                        cute virtual cards, but I wanted to do something for you since 
                        we're far away. I'll probably write another card for you, because this
                        is a bit ghetto -_- <br> But I hope you have another amazing year baby. 
                        I'm so proud of how hard you've been working/growing in the past year. 
                        Can't wait to see you again and enjoy birthday funzies with you~
